# LDES Ingest and server example

## Install

```sh
# root of repo install
npm install
npm run build

# download and install pipeline dependencies
cd ingest
npm install
cd node_modules/js-runner
npm install
npm run build

# compile local processor
cd -
npx tsc
```


## Run Ingest

Make sure your local mongodb is up and running.
Running the ingest will populate the database some simple members (1 per second).
This ingest uses the [Connector architecture](https://the-connector-architecture.github.io/site/) to run the pipeline.
The original data is generated by the locally provided processor, see the code at `src/generate.ts`.

```sh
npm run ingest
```


## Run the server

The ldes solid server uses the solid server 5.0.0 with a new LDES store mounted at `/ldes/`.
```sh
npm run server
```

Browse to [LDES xplorer](https://xplorer.avercruysse.be/ldes/http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A3000%2Fldes%2F) to see the LDES.
